            <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare the Pie Crust:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the cold cubed butter and mix with a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Do not overmix.</li>
                        <li>Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). On a floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Place the dough in the pie pan and trim any excess. Poke holes in the bottom with a fork to prevent bubbling.</li>
                        <li>Line the crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for about 10-15 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment, then bake for an additional 5 minutes until lightly golden. Set aside to cool.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Walnut Filling:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped walnuts, sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir until well combined.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assemble and Bake:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pour the walnut filling into the pre-baked pie crust, spreading it evenly.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is set and slightly puffed. The center may still be slightly jiggly but will firm up as it cools.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cool and Serve:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.</li>
                        <li>Serve the walnut pie at room temperature, optionally topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store any leftovers covered at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week.</li>
                <li><strong>Additions:</strong> You can add chocolate chips or a splash of bourbon to the filling for added flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Nut Variations:</strong> You can mix walnuts with pecans or other nuts if desired.</li>
            </ul>

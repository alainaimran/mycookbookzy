            <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare the Coffee Mixture:</strong>
                    In a shallow dish, combine the brewed espresso (or strong coffee), coffee liqueur (if using), and sugar (if desired). Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside to cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Cream Mixture:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form.</li>
                        <li>In another bowl, mix the mascarpone cheese, sugar, vanilla extract, and coffee liqueur (if using) until smooth and well combined.</li>
                        <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully combined and smooth. Be careful not to deflate the whipped cream.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assemble the Tiramisu:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring they are soaked but not soggy. A quick dip on each side is usually enough.</li>
                        <li>In a rectangular dish (8x8 inch or similar), arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers on the bottom. Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture over the ladyfingers.</li>
                        <li>Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers followed by the remaining mascarpone cream mixture. Smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chill and Serve:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results. This allows the flavors to meld.</li>
                        <li>Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder and add chocolate shavings if desired.</li>
                        <li>Cut into squares and serve chilled. Enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Tiramisu can be made a day in advance, which helps improve the flavor as it sits.</li>
                <li><strong>Customize:</strong> You can substitute the coffee liqueur with vanilla extract or omit it for a non-alcoholic version.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavors:</strong> For a twist, consider adding different flavors such as orange zest or a flavored liqueur like hazelnut.</li>

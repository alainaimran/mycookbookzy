            <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Dough:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of flour, sugar, instant yeast, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the warm milk, warm water, melted butter, and eggs. Whisk until well combined.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Mix until combined.</li>
                        <li>Add the remaining flour, one cup at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
                        <li>Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a small bowl, mix the softened butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon until well combined. If using nuts or raisins, mix them in as well.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll the dough into a rectangle about 16x12 inches.</li>
                        <li>Spread the cinnamon filling evenly over the dough rectangle.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shape the Rolls:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Starting from the long side, tightly roll the dough into a log. Pinch the seam to seal.</li>
                        <li>Using a sharp knife or dental floss, cut the log into 12 equal pieces (about 1-1.5 inches wide).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Let the Rolls Rise:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Arrange the rolls in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish or on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
                        <li>Cover with a cloth and let them rise again for about 30 minutes, or until puffy.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bake the Rolls:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
                        <li>Bake the rolls for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Cream Cheese Frosting (Optional):</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, mixing until creamy. Add milk to thin if needed.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Serve:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Once the rolls are out of the oven, let them cool slightly before spreading the cream cheese frosting on top. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the rolls and place them in the fridge overnight before the second rise. Just take them out in the morning and let them rise at room temperature while the oven preheats.</li>
                <li><strong>Variations:</strong> Feel free to add chocolate chips, dried fruit, or even switch out the frosting for a simple glaze.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to a week.</li>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup hot water</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup ground meat (pork, chicken, or beef)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup finely chopped vegetables (cabbage, carrots, or onions)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <h3>1. Make the Dough</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mix the Dough:</strong>
                    In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add the hot water while stirring with a fork or chopsticks until the dough starts to come together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Knead the Dough:</strong>
                    Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough is sticky, add a little more flour as needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rest the Dough:</strong>
                    Cover the kneaded dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mix the Filling:</strong>
                    In a bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped vegetables, soy sauce, sesame oil (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly combined.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. Form the Dumplings</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong>
                    After resting, divide the dough into small portions (about the size of a golf ball). Roll each portion into a thin circle (about 3 inches in diameter) on a floured surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fill the Dumplings:</strong>
                    Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each dough circle. Be careful not to overfill, as this can make sealing difficult.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Seal the Dumplings:</strong>
                    Moisten the edges of the dough with a little water, fold it in half over the filling, and pinch the edges to seal. You can also make pleats for a decorative touch.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4. Cook the Dumplings</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Boil:</strong>
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the dumplings into the boiling water. Cook for about 5-7 minutes or until they float to the surface and are cooked through.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Steam (Alternative Method):</strong>
                    Place the dumplings in a steamer basket lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Steam over boiling water for about 10-12 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>5. Serve</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve the dumplings hot with a dipping sauce made of soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil if desired.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dipping Sauce:</strong> Mix soy sauce with rice vinegar and add a dash of chili oil for extra flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Uncooked dumplings can be frozen on a baking sheet and then stored in a zip-top bag for future use. Cook them from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</li>
                <li><strong>Variations:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different fillings, such as tofu, shrimp, or different vegetables according to your taste.</li>
